# PROGRESS — AI Usage Logger

Single handoff file. Every new session reads CLAUDE.md then this file before doing anything.

Last updated: 2026-09-18

## Current phase

**Phase 1 — Dev root CA in Go.**

Task in progress right now: `internal/platform` trust interface plus the darwin
implementation of `aiul ca trust` / `aiul ca untrust`.

## Plan for Phase 0

1. Create repo skeleton: /agent (Go module), /backend, /scripts, /docs, CLAUDE.md, .gitignore.
2. `git init` and first commit.
3. Check Homebrew tooling: go, php@8.3, composer, docker (Docker Desktop), mitmproxy. Report what is missing; the user installs or approves installs.
4. `go mod init` + `cmd/aiul` with a `version` command only.
5. docker-compose.yml with Postgres, Redis, MinIO (all bound to 127.0.0.1).
6. Write docs/DECISIONS.md and docs/SETUP-MAC.md.
7. Milestone verification commands handed to the user; STOP.

## Done

- Repo skeleton, `.gitignore` (blocks keys/certs/spool from day one), `CLAUDE.md`
- `docs/PROGRESS.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md` (D1-D4), `docs/SETUP-MAC.md`
- Tooling check: Go 1.24.4, PHP 8.4.23 (Herd), Composer, mitmproxy 12.2.3, git present
- Go module `github.com/pkisan/aiul`; `cmd/aiul/main.go` with `aiul version`; `go vet` clean
- `docker-compose.yml`: Postgres 16 (127.0.0.1:5433), Redis 7 (127.0.0.1:6380), MinIO (127.0.0.1:9000/9001)
- git repository initialised, first commit `3e9c53c`

### Phase 1 (in progress)

- `scripts/killswitch.sh` — written, dry run verified clean on this Mac (`7ff6d87`)
- Go module renamed to `github.com/pkisan/aiul` (`7ff6d87`)
- `internal/ca/ca.go` — dev root creation, load, paths, fingerprint; key written 0600
- `internal/ca/leaf.go` — `MintLeaf`, 24h leaves, SAN from hosts, ECDSA P-256
- `internal/ca/ca_test.go` — 7 tests, all passing, including a real TLS handshake
  against a server using a leaf we minted

## In progress

- `internal/platform` (TrustInstaller interface + darwin implementation) and the
  `aiul ca init|trust|untrust|info` commands.

## Next step

Write `internal/platform/platform.go`, `trust_darwin.go`, stubs for linux/windows,
then wire the `ca` commands in `cmd/aiul`.

## Left — Phase 1

- [x] scripts/killswitch.sh (BEFORE any system change) + dry run verified
- [x] internal/ca: root creation, load, leaf minting
- [x] internal/ca unit tests
- [ ] internal/platform TrustInstaller + darwin impl + linux/windows stubs
- [ ] `aiul ca init|trust|untrust|info` commands (trust shows the command and asks first)
- [ ] `aiul ca demo-server` — tiny local HTTPS server on a minted leaf, for the Safari test
- [ ] Milestone: Safari loads the demo server with no warning after trust, warns again after untrust

## Left — Phase 0

- [x] Repo skeleton + CLAUDE.md + .gitignore + git init
- [x] Tooling check (go, php, composer, mitmproxy) — Docker Desktop MISSING
- [x] Go module + `aiul version`
- [x] docker-compose.yml (Postgres, Redis, MinIO)
- [x] docs/DECISIONS.md, docs/SETUP-MAC.md
- [ ] Owner installs Docker Desktop (`brew install --cask docker`) — needs approval, not run
- [ ] Milestone: `aiul version` runs; `docker compose ps` healthy; curl through mitmweb with explicit --proxy in one terminal only

## Left — later phases

- [ ] Phase 2 — proxy engine (CONNECT, classify, mint, stream, SSE reassembly, parsers, spool)
- [ ] Phase 3 — redaction
- [ ] Phase 4 — endpoint agent (darwin platform impls, install/uninstall/status/doctor, forwarder)
- [ ] Phase 5 — task tagging (lsof → pid → cwd → git branch → task ID)
- [ ] Phase 6 — Laravel ingestion + storage + scoring
- [ ] Phase 7 — Inertia + Vue dashboard

## Blockers / open questions for the user

- PHP is 8.4.23 via Herd, not 8.3. Laravel 12 supports 8.4, so we use it (D4).
- Go module path confirmed as `github.com/pkisan/aiul`.
- **Before Phase 2 starts:** rule 11 requires a written comparison of stdlib-only
  vs goproxy vs go-mitmproxy in DECISIONS.md, with a recommendation, confirmed by
  the owner.
- Phase 1 needs one approval from the owner: running `aiul ca trust`, which adds
  our dev root CA to the System keychain. The exact command is shown before it runs.

## Things the user must run by hand

- Phase 1 milestone verification (Safari test) — commands supplied at the end of the phase.

## Machine state — settings currently changed on this Mac

**NONE.** No system proxy, no keychain trust, no env vars, no launchd jobs, no /etc/zshenv block.

Undo commands will be listed here the moment anything changes. From Phase 1 onward, `scripts/killswitch.sh` reverts everything in one command.
